## Introduction
This is aimed at fellow students studying the [Google IT Support Professional Certificate](https://grow.google/programs/it-support/) on Coursera. You see, I take a lot of notes. It's kinda my thing. üòÖ Usually, I type up my notes in TextEdit, and store them in local directories by topic. Other times, I'll jot them down in a spiral notebook on my desk.

But then it hit me: *What if my notes could help other people?* After all, I already type my notes up in Markdown -- it's as simple as a copy/paste to share them. So I made this repository! 

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note that these notes are of November 2020.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## How to Use
- In the repository's [main page](https://github.com/Clifton893/Google-IT-Support-Notes), click into the folder named for the week you want to learn more about. 
- From there, you'll find my notes! 
- My notes range from key takeaways from lessons, to helpful reminders for review, to links for further reading or learning.
- **Also**, each week's file will be periodically updated, as needed. I want to make it easier for you to read, ya know? üòÑ

## Disclaimer
This repository and its content is intended purely as a supplement to Google's IT Support course, not as an alternative or "freebie." These notes are my important takeaways from each lesson.

It ***doesn't*** include quiz questions or assessments, or "how to pass." Rather, I list keywords and concepts you should review to prepare yourself.

All credit and thanks go to Google and Coursera, for making such a great program.
